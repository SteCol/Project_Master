Hi, 

So I've been looking into using a smartphone's gyroscope and descided to use Google VR to control the camera. The problem that I'm having now is that I can't find a way to disable the two-screen sterioscopic view. 

Here's a list of things I've tried:

GvrViewer.Instance.VRModeEnabled doesn't work.
changing the bool in the script to false doesn't either.

GvrViewer.Instance.ToggleDeviceVRMode(false) WORKS!



There is no option to do so in the build settings.
